Ionic compounds: Made up of charged particles called ions, and are typically soluble in water. Ionic compounds with hydrogen ions are acids, while those with basic ions are bases. Ionic compounds without these ions are called salts. 
Covalent compounds: Made up of atoms that share electrons, and are not typically soluble in water. Covalent compounds are also more flammable than ionic compounds. 
Organic compounds: Covalent compounds that contain carbon atoms bonded to hydrogen atoms. Organic compounds are sometimes called carbon compounds because they exist in living beings. 
Coordinate compounds: Made up of anions or neutral molecules that are bound to a central atom. 
Intermetallic compounds: A type of metallic alloy that forms a solid-state compound.
